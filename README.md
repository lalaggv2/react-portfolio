# README  

This is my first attempt at building a portfolio with React. I used a tuturial to help me and customized a little bit.

## Json Data
For the project details I am using a json file and making a "get" request to get the details. So in the future I can directly add a new project into my json file which will automatically be rendered.

## Built With
React
JavaScript (ES6)
Node.js
npm
Create-React-App
SCSS
